// Question:
/*
We are given a chess board and a piece with a fixed position (immovable).
We also have a bishop on the board which, well of course, can only move diagonally.
- Return "YES" if we can reach the immovable piece using the bishop, else return "NO".
- If "YES", return the number of minimum steps it takes for the bishop to reach the immovable piece.

Hint: Something to do with the number of squares on the x and y axes.
