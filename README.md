Algorithm and experimental problems with solution

Q1. Reverse all the vowels in a given string?
- ask if any doubt
- ask if we need optimization

Q2. Find the second lowest element efficiently?
- edge cases: check minimum lenght > 1


Q1. Given String s = "aababbccde";
Output: a3b3c2d1e1, retain the order of first occurrence
Ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-program-count-occurrences-character/

Q2. Why hascode is used
- comparing int is faster than string / employee etc., so hashcode is used
- since it is int, we can find any int easily

Q3. Sliding window problems: 1,8,5,3,12,10,3,2,7
Find 5 continuous sub-arrays which has the highest total:
- brute force: will be expensive here
- sliding window: should be more efficient
- it is used when we need to get contagious sub-array

Q3. Given an array. find the Subarray where sum = k.

Q4. Find first non repeating number in an array
- try with array implementations
- also, we can use LinkedHashMap

Q5. Find first repeating number in an array

Q5. Longest substring without repeat.

Q6. Remove duplicates from a sorted array

Q7. //Given a sentence/phrase and two words,//    return the minimum distance between the words.////Example://String str = “the quick the brown quick brown the frog”//String word1 = “quick”//String word2 = "frog"//return 2
 
Q8. Check if a word is a palindrome:
sol1: starting from two ends
sol2: starting from middle // use two pointers
